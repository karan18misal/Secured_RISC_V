This project details the hardware implementation of a secured 32-bit RISC-V processor core, executing the RV32I base instruction set and strictly following a Load-Store Architecture. The key innovation is the integration of a dedicated Security Unit between the Register Bank and the Memory Module, designed to enforce data security for critical memory regions (addresses 0 to 127). Data written to this region is ENCRYPTED (via a quadratic transformation), and data read from it is DECRYPTED (via a non-linear transformation and bitwise negation), all authorized by a key-based access control (0x0032). The core comprises standard modules—top main, Control Unit, ALU, Memory Module, and Registers Module—and was rigorously verified using a layered SystemVerilog testbench to ensure functional correctness and robust security features across the entire instruction set.
